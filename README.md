This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Ruby related to getter-only methods.  The `bug.rb` file shows the incorrect implementation, where assigning a value to the `value` method doesn't modify the internal state. The `bugSolution.rb` file offers a corrected approach using an attr_accessor or explicit setter method. This example highlights the importance of understanding Ruby's method definition behavior and how to correctly manage object state.
